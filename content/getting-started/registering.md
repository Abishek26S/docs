title: Sign up to Codewars
---

You’ve decided to join Codewars; that’s great! If you need help signing up, follow these steps to create your new account and start solving tasks (Kata), learning, and improving your programming skills! 

## How to sign up 
First, go to our [sign-up](https://www.codewars.com/join) page. Here, you will have the option to create a Codewars account in one of two ways;  
1. Type your username and email address, and create a password.
2. Sign up using your GitHub Account.  
 
**Important note:**
Once your account is set up, you will receive an email asking to confirm your email address. Please be aware that certain features on Codewars will be limited until your account is confirmed. Check your spam folder if you cannot find the email in your inbox.

If you can’t find this email, you can request it again by logging into your account, heading to your ‘account settings,’ and selecting ‘resend.’  
 
## Establish your training settings 
Once you have signed up, you can select some training settings on Codewars. These settings will help us recommend challenges (Kata) to you and provide you with more opportunities on Codewars. These settings allow you to tell us how much programming experience you have, what languages you have experience in, and what programming languages you wish to train in (e.g., what languages you will challenge yourself with Codewars Kata). 
 
## What’s next? 
Once your training settings have been saved, you will be brought to your training dashboard. Here, you will find your allies (accounts you follow or members of your [Clan](https://docs.codewars.com/community/following/#clans)), the latest comments on Codewars, and, most importantly, your [next challenge to solve](https://docs.codewars.com/getting-started/finding-kata/). 
 
You’re now ready to train on Codewars; enjoy!
